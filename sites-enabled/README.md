# This folder contains the nginx configuration files for all active sites.

# Add a new site using the following command:

# sudo ln -s sites-available/example.com sites-enabled/example.com

# To remove the site, simply delete the symlink:

# sudo rm sites-enabled/example.com

# To activate or deactive configuration files, you must reload the configuration files into nginx. You can do this by either reloading the configuration files or restarting nginx using the following commands:

# sudo service nginx reload

# sudo service nginx restart
